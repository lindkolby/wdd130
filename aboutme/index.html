    <h2>Kolby Lind</h2>
    <p>Hello my name is Kolby Lind. I am the 2nd child of 4. I grew up moving from place to place so I have been able to get to know different parts of the country.
        I am a computer science major, and hope to build my career off of the degree I obtain. I am getting married this summer and plan to do so in an LDS temple. 
        I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints my whole life. I served a full-time mission in Atlanta, Georgia.</p>
