            <h2>Start With an Idea (Any Idea)</h2>
            <p>You do not need a full sketch or fancy mockup to get started. Just shoot us a message with what you are thinking. It could be as simple as, “I want something with my dogs name,” or “I need a gift for my sisters wedding.” We will ask a few questions, offer up ideas, and go from there.</p>

            <h2>Designing Together</h2>
            <p>Once we have nailed down the general concept, we will work through the details—like fonts, colors, size, wood type, and layout. We will send you a mockup or sample sketch so you can see how it is shaping up. And we will not start building until you give us the green light.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="piece">
            <h2>Making Your Piece</h2>
            <p> Now for the fun part—building it! Everything we make is handcrafted in our shop, using real tools, real wood, and real care. We cut, carve, paint, stain, and seal each piece by hand. We will keep you updated throughout the process and let you know when it is ready to ship or pick up.</p>

        <section class="information">
            <h2>What You Will Need to Tell Us</h2>
            <p>To make your custom piece, we will ask for a few key things:</p>
            <p>What you want it to say or include (names, quotes, dates, etc.)</p>
            <p>The general size or where it is going (wall, shelf, gift box, etc.)</p>
            <p>Your preferred style, colors, and vibe.</p>
            <p>Any deadline you are working with (events, holidays, etc.)</p>
            <p>Not sure about all of that? No problem. We will help you figure it out.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="honest">
            <h2>Simple, Honest, No Surprises</h2>
            <p>We believe in honest pricing and clear timelines. Once we know what you want, we will give you a quote and estimated turnaround time. Most projects take about 1 to 2 weeks, depending on our schedule and the complexity of your piece. No hidden fees. No last-minute surprises. Just good communication and great work.</p>
